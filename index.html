              I started to my coding journey with this project. The project is
              about joining the balloon tour during sunset in beautiful
              Cappadocia, Turkey. On VS Code, I built a simple page using HTML,
              CSS and thanks to JavaScript, the Join Balloon Tour button was
              enabled. After 3-week of SheCodes Basic course, I deserved to get
              the certificate of "Introduction to Coding" which is published on
              my LinkedIn profile.
              <br />
              <br />
              To apply the balloon tour, you just need to answer some questions.
              The criteria here is the age limit. People who are less than 16
              years old are not allowed to join this tour without their parent`s
              permissions. When you are old enough (equal or more than 16
              years), the page is asking for your email to send more information
              (in the real tour case of course). I added some information about
              Cappadocia as well. As you wish, you can read the rest of the text
              by clicking on Read more on Wikipedia. You can have a try to test
              the code by clicking on Learn More as well! Have fun. üôåüèº

              I started with a real-life development workflow to the project.
              I‚Äôve learnt how to save the code at GitHub by creating the project
              repository. I improved CSS properties by using Bootstrap, and more
              importantly how to integrate the weather condition data to the
              code by API. Especially Weather App project was a big challenge
              for me to improve my JavaScript skill. I also practiced to code on
              SandBox Code beside VS Code. In the end, I hosted the app on
              Netlify to share. I shared my certificate of "Front-end
              Development" on LinkedIn after completing 8-week of SheCodes+
              workshop.

              On the project, not only can you see the current time and weather
              condition of the current location; but also you can search for any
              other city to see its weather data. I also added five days weather
              forecast at the bottom. You can have a try to test the code by
              clicking on Learn More! I hope you‚Äôll like it. üôåüèº

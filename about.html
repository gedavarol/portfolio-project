              I was born in 1991 in Istanbul, Turkey. I have bachelor and master
              degrees about Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from
              Istanbul Technical University. I came to Barcelona in 2017 by
              Erasmus Exchange Programme to write my master thesis.
              <br />
              I wanted to change my career to have a chance for working with an
              international team in the IT sector. I always admired Spanish
              culture and language, thatâ€™s why I started to search for a job
              especially in Spain. Finally my dream came true and I had a chance
              to work in Barcelona. I am currently working at GoDaddy as a
              vender. I am also in charge of solving technical problems in
              domains, SSL certificates and hosting websites.
              <br />
              The opportunity to learn new skills and work with new technologies
              is particularly attractive for me. Therefore, I was willing to go
              further, to learn about coding as well. I found SheCodes workshops
              on the internet and I found them very interesting. I've learnt a
              lot from SheCodes workshops such as HTML, advanced CSS,
              JavaScript, API, Responsive, and I keep learning even more. I
              believe that my strong technical experience, education (ABET
              Accredited Program) and study of coding workshops will make me
              very successful in software sector as a front-end developer.
